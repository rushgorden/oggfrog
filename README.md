Michael David Crawford's Ogg music ripper

Mike is a friend of mine and I had alpha tested his Ogg music player and audio ripper.

He fell into some bad luck, and his website got deleted and he lost his source code and all of his work.

I recovered this from a CD-R backup, including some of the source code from 2006.

Mike's new website is http://www.warplife.com/ you can contact him there about Oggfrog or Warplife
