Michael David Crawford's Ogg music ripper

Mike is a friend of mine and I had alpha tested his Ogg music player and audio ripper.

He fell into some bad luck, and his website got deleted and he lost his source code and all of his work.

I recovered this from a CD-R backup, including some of the source code from 2006.

Mike's new website is http://www.warplife.com/ you can contact him there about Oggfrog or Warplife

Which should soon be available at http://git.warplife.com/ and then this Guthub repository will be deleted.

Originally Crawford did not allow his code to be distributed, it was added here by mistake. It is open sourced, but he didn't want to make it public for some reason not given to us.

This project has been liberated by Blastar of India and China:
