/**
\defgroup Tuplestore Tuplestore
A tuplestore is simply a humungous array of 2^64 tuples. Each entry in the array can be
considered as being an ID/tuple pair, where the ID is simply the index into the array,
and thus each entry's ID is unique within the tuplestore.

A tuplestore is fixed in size and always fully populated so that every entry has a tuple.
When first created it contains 2^64 \em empty tuples, which is why you don't need
2^64 * x bytes of storage to create a tuplestore -- it's a sparse array in which empty tuples
needn't be physically stored.

In addition a tuplestore allocates IDs, on demand it will return IDs that have never been
allocated before and  never will again. This lets us add new data to a tuplestore without
overwriting IDs that have already been used.

The class ZTS defines an API for reading and writing entries in a tuplestore. Generally though
you'll use a \ref Tuplebase or a \ref Tuplesoup instance, depending on whether you want
transactional database-like features, or the more UI-friendly soup access.

\class ZTS
\nosubgrouping
\ingroup Tuplestore

ZTS defines an API for managing the huge, fixed-size, sparse array of tuples discussed in
\ref Tuplestore. ZTS::SetTuples and ZTS::GetTuples provide access to the tuples themselves.
ZTS::AllocateIDs manages the issuance of entries that have never been used before. ZTS::Search
allows the identification of entries whose tuples match a ZTBSpec. ZTS::GetReadLock and
ZTS::GetWriteLock provide access to the reader/writer lock which arbitrates access to the tuples.
