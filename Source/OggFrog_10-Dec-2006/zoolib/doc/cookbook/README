Building the ZooLib Cookbook

January 27, 2002

Type "make html" to produce the ZooLib Cookbook as HTML.  The output will
be placed in a directory named db2html-dir.  But see the note below about
mydb2html - you will likely need to edit the pathnames in it for the 
placement of some of the files on your particular system.

You will need jade, the DocBook XML 4.1.2 DTD and Normal Walsh's DSSSL 
stylesheets installed on your system.  You can use OpenJade instead of Jade
if you edit doc/tools/mydb2html appropriately.  See http://www.docbook.org/
for the starting point for all of these.

Installing the DocBook tools, stylesheets and DTD's is a difficult task for
the beginner.  It is much better if you can find the stuff pre-packaged for
the system you use.

For Slackware, you can get these if you install the sgmltools from the
contrib CD (I think that's CD #3), or you can download it 
from ftp.slackware.com.

For Debian, you will need the docbook-xml, docbook-dsssl and jade packages.

You don't need the vanilla docbook package for this, that is the classic
DocBook SGML DTD.  I am using the DSSSL stylesheets and not the XSL stylesheets,
although I will likely change the XSL at some time in the future (stylesheets
are used to control the transformation of the marked-up source into 
presentation formats like HTML or PDF; jade and openjade are DSSSL stylesheet
processors, while xslt is an XSL stylesheet processor.)

The mydb2html script is set up with pathnames to the stylesheets, XML
declaration and such as they are installed on Slackware.  You will need
to find where the things live on your system and change the pathnames
appropriately.  Try looking also in /etc/sgml, /usr/lib/sgml, and
/usr/share/sgml

mydb2html is a simple modification to the popular db2html script which has
been hacked to add the XML declaration to the jade command line.  It would
be helpful to have a better script that would detect the type of file used
and be able to process both DocBook XML and classic DocBook (SGML) documents
from a single script.

The Makefile is not yet set up to make PDF, postscript or other print forms
of the document.  This will come in its time.

I would like to write up more detailed notes on getting started with DocBook
but don't have the opportunity right now.  I had a really hard time getting
started (taking two years to get started writing the cookbook) and the posts
I see on the mailing lists indicate others have as much trouble.

You may find the docbook and docbook-apps mailing lists helpful.  Use
the docbook lists for questions about markup or generally using the DocBook
DTD itself.  Use docbook-apps for questions about processing your documents,
making stylesheet customizations, using jade or openjade and so on.  You
can find out how to subscribe at:

http://www.docbook.org/mailinglist/index.html

The lists are archived, maybe your question is already answered:

Note that the ZooLib cookbook is written in the newer DocBook XML DTD,
rather than the original DocBook.  A lot of the DocBook processing software
that is out there is not yet set up to handle DocBook XML, which is why I
had to modify db2html.

There are certain requirements a document must meet to be well-formed XML.
This has required certain modifications to the original DocBook SGML DTD
to make DocBook XML, and you will need to observe them if you edit this 
document.  Most significantly, XML tags are case sensitive (use all lowercase
for your markup), attributes must be quoted with either single or double
quotes, and unclosed tags are not allowed.

I suggest editing the XML files in Emacs using psgml and xml-mode.  You can
get psgml from:

http://www.lysator.liu.se/projects/about_psgml.html

If you have the psgml library loaded before you open the XML files, I have
emacs file variables in them that will set things up for psgml.

You can find a lot of introductory documents about XML at:

http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/xmlIntro.html

You can read "DocBook: The Definitive Guide" online at:

http://www.docbook.org/tdg/en/html/docbook.html

O'Reilly publishes this book, but I think the version currently in print
does not cover the XML DTD.  I'm not sure about that.  So far I'm not doing
anything really weird with DocBook so it is likely the print version will 
still be helpful.

Finally, I am happy to answer your questions, and I am very appreciative
of suggestions for how I can improve what I've written here.
