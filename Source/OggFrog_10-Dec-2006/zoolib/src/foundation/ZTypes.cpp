/** \defgroup group_Types Types
Although the standard library defines a range of integer types in cstdint,
older versions of the library may not define the complete range, or 
the types may conflict with types used in platform specific headers. Also some
compilers differ in their representation of 64 bit integers. To harmonize
these disparate environments ZTypes.h defines a useful standard set of
integer types of known size and signedness that are tuned to be maximally
compatible with each target platform.
