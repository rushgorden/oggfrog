\defgroup group_Unicode Unicode
\sa ZUnicode

If you're unfamiliar with Unicode I recommend reading Markus Kuhn's excellent backgrounder
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html">UTF-8 and Unicode FAQ for Unix/Linux</a>.

"The Unicode Standard Version 3.0" (Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-61633-5) is an essential reference.

In working with Unicode data it is crucial to understand the distinction
between code points and code units. A clear discussion is at
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr17/">Unicode Technical Report
#17, Character Encoding Model</a>. In ZooLib a Unicode code point is an integer in the
range 0-0xD7FF or 0xE000-0x10FFFF that represents the corresponding character as
defined by Unicode and ISO 10646. This requires at least 21 bits of space,
and is most conveniently manipulated in a 32 bit integer.

A code unit may be large enough to hold an arbitrary code point, but generally more
than one code unit may be required.
*/

/**
\namespace ZUnicode
\brief The ZUnicode namespace defines a collection of data types and functions for
working with Unicode data.
\ingroup group_Unicode
\sa group_Unicode

ZUnicode does not directly address internationalization and localization issues, but it
is an important building block in support of such work.

ZUnicode defines three integer types used to hold code units:
	- \c UTF32. A 32 bit integer. On platforms where \c wchar_t is 32 bits in size, \c UTF32 \e is
a \c wchar_t, otherwise it is a \c uint32.
	- \c UTF16. A 16 bit integer. On platforms where \c wchar_t is 16 bits in size, \c UTF16 \e is
a \c wchar_t, otherwise it is a \c uint16.
	- \c UTF8. An 8 bit integer. It is a typedef of \c char.

and three corresponding string types:
	- \c string32.
	- \c string16.
	- \c string8. This will be equivalent to \c std::string.

If you need to work with individual code points use \c UTF32. In general \c UTF16 and \c UTF8
can hold only individual code units of their type. It may be that the UTF-16 or UTF-8
representation of a particular code point can be represented in a single code unit, but should
never be relied upon in your code.

<h3>Legal code points</h3>

ISO 10646 formally defines a 31 bit character set, the range of legal code points is
thus from 0 to 0x7FFFFFFF. This range is considered to be divided into 32768 planes of
65536 code points. As of this writing characters have only been assigned to plane 0,
the so-called Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP). There is a committment to never assign 
characters beyond plane 16. So the range of legal code points is restricted to
0 to 0x10FFFF (1,114,112 distinct code points). UCS-4 and UTF-8 can represent the
entire 31 bit range, but UTF-16 is unable to represent code points beyond plane 16.

<h3>Illegal code units and code unit sequences</h3>

There are two illegal code units in UTF-8, 0xFE and 0xFF. It's also possible to have
sequences of UTF-8 code units which are illegal, that is which do not map to a code point.
For example if a continuation byte is not preceded by a start byte, or if a start byte
is not immediately followed by enough continuation bytes.

UTF-16 also has illegal code unit sequences, in particular a high surrogate that
is not followed by a low surrogate, or a low surrogate without a preceding high surrogate.

\c UTF32 is a 32 bit integer, and thus can represent values outside the 31 bit ISO 10646
range. So it's clearly possible to have \c UTF32 code units that do not map to a code point. Given
that Unicode and ISO 10646 will never assign characters beyond plane 16, we further restrict
valid UTF-32 code units to be in the range 0 to 0x10FFFF. Finally, code units from the
high and low surrgate blocks (0xDC00 to 0xDFFF) are also illegal. Strictly speaking U+FFFF
and all code points of the form U+xxFFFF are illegal, but we don't filter them out.

The Unicode standard recommends that illegal code units are each decoded as U+FFFD, the
replacement character. That's a good strategy when decoding a body of material in
one hit, but it's ambiguous when randomly accessing data in memory. ZUnicode's
convention is that illegal code units and code unit sequences are skipped.
They contribute to any count of code units, but do not generate code points and do not
contribute to any count of code points. So a pointer into a sequence of code units
is considered to reference the first valid code point starting at or subsequent to the
pointer. Conversely, illegal code points, those outside the ranges 0-0xD7FF and 0xE000-0x10FFFF,
are treated as being of zero length. They will not cause generation of code units nor
contribute to counts of code points.

An example of mapping between offsets and code points is perhaps in order. The following
represents ten UTF-8 code units, with offsets of contained bytes from zero to nine and
offset ten being the end of the buffer:

\verbatim
Offset  Description
------  -----------
 0      Start of 3 byte sequence, with two continuation bytes following
 3      Single byte character
 4      Single byte character
 5      An out of order continuation byte (illegal)
 6      Start of 2 byte sequence, with single continuation byte following
 8      Single byte character
 9      Start byte of two byte sequence without continuation byte (illegal)
10      End of the buffer

Offset    01234567890
Value     3CCNNC2CN2
Illegal   -----X---X

The table below shows for each offset which offset will be returned/used when
decremented, accessed or incremented. You should note that illegal byte sequences
are effectively transparent to those operations.

Offset  Dec  Acc  Inc
 0       -    0    3
 1       0    3    4
 2       0    3    4
 3       0    3    4
 4       3    4    6
 5       4    6    8
 6       4    6    8
 7       6    8    -
 8       6    8    -
 9       8    -    -
10       8    -    -
\endverbatim



\bug
CodeWarrior building for Mach-o defines wchar_t to be a 32 bits in size. The CW debugger,
as of 8.3 at least, always treats wchar_t as being 16 bits in size, which can make
things very confusing. You can have the compiler define wchar_t to be 16 bits in size
by using <code>#pragma ushort_wchar_t on</code>
