#include "ZGeom.h"

// AG 98-05-04. Major rework. Because it's possible to have more than one graphics
// API available simultaneously on the same machine (QD and GDI when using QuickTime
// on Windows) we have to be more circumspect about allowing the passing of ZPoints and
// ZRects to OS routines. These types *used* to have conversion operators that could
// implicitly return a pointer to a Point (for example) when a ZPoint was used as a parameter
// to a routine. Handy, but not easy to support when more than one API is active at once.
