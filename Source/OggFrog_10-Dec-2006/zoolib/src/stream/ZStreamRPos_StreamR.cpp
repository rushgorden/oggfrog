/**
ZStreamRPos_StreamR takes a source ZStreamR, and a ZStreamRWPos to use as a buffer. Its
size and position are taken from the ZStreamRWPos. A read or call to SetPosition that would
move beyond the end of the ZStreamRWPos is handled by copying more data from the ZStreamR
to the end of the ZStreamRWPos.

The ZStreamRPos_StreamR::Committed() can be called at any time and as often as you like, but
once it has been called it is then an error to use any of the position/size methods. Committed
returns a ZStreamR reference, which will refer to the ZStreamRPos_StreamR if the buffer stream
is not yet exhausted and thus if reads should be satisfied by pulling at least some data from
it. If the ZStreamRWPos is known to be exhausted when Committed is called (i.e. if
GetPosition() == GetSize()) then Committed is returns a reference to the source ZStreamR, so
reads can bypass the indirection that imposed by using the ZStreamRPos_StreamR directly.

This class is useful when you have a ZStreamR to which you need random access for only some
amount of data at the head. That might be the case, for example, when handling a graphic
format that has fiddly meta-data at the beginning, followed by arbitrary data that need not
be accessed randomly.
