/**
\class ZStreamR_Random
\ingroup stream
The sequence of bytes is determined by the seed passed to the stream's constructor. An instantiated
stream's sequence can be reset by calling ZStreamR_Random::SetSeed. It's most useful as the source
to a read filter stream which needs to be tested against non-homegenous but repeatable data, and
where you don't want to have to manually generate that sequence.
