For those of you that want to get started right away, here are the five basicsteps to integrate Mercutio into your application:1.  Add the “MercutioMDEF.rsrc” file into your project. There are 3	resource types that are needed: the “Mercutio” MDEF resource,	and the “.MDEF Font” NFNT and FOND resources. Copy them all the	resources in this file to the resource file for your application. Do	not renumber them.2.  Change the MDEF field in your MENU resources to 19999, the resource	ID of the Mercutio MDEF. Don’t change this resource number.3.  For Pascal, add the “Mercutio API.p” file to your project. For C, add	the “Mercutio API.c” and “Mercutio API.h” files to your project and add	#include "Mercutio.h" to your code.4.  Replace any calls to the toolbox MenuKey routine with the with new	MDEF_MenuKey call. This replacement is needed in order to parse	the additional modifier keys. Most likely you will have an event	loop routine that looks something like this:	CASE event.what OF		keyDown, AutoKey:			BEGIN			theKey := BitAnd(Event.message, charCodeMask);			IF (BitAnd(Event.modifiers, CmdKey) = CmdKey) THEN BEGIN				menuResult := menuKey(theKey);				if HiWord(menuResult) <> 0 THEN BEGIN					ProcessMenu(menuResult);					HiliteMenu(0);					END;				END;			ELSE BEGIN { cmd not down; handle typing if needed }				...	which should be changed to look like this:	CASE event.what OF		keyDown, AutoKey:	      BEGIN	      theKey := BitAnd(Event.message, charCodeMask);	      menuResult := MDEF_MenuKey(Event.message, Event.modifiers, hAnMDEFMenu);	      IF HiWord(menuResult) <> 0 THEN BEGIN	         ProcessMenu(menuResult);	         HiliteMenu(0);	         END;	      ELSE BEGIN { wasn’t caught by the menus }	         ...   Note   ----   The third parameter to the MDEF_MenuKey routine must be a handle to a menu    that is using the Mercutio MDEF. It can be ANY Mercutio handle.5. Recompile your application.That’s it! Run your program. Any menu item in condense style will show an option key modifier in addition to the command key; any menu item in extend style with show an shift key modifier in addition to the command key.
