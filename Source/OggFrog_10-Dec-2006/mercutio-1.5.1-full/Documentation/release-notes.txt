The following changes were made in this release.version 1.5.1--------------- Mercutio now pays attention to the "Use Grayscale Appearance" setting in the Appearance Manager control panel as well as whether or not the application is Appearance-Manager-registered. In particular, registered applications will now use the 3D grayscale bevelled look. - Left margin spacing adjusted to more closely match the Appearance Manager MDEF.- Left and right margins on menus match Appearance Manager layout.- Text color in hilighted items is now white, not gray.- Scroll arrows now correctly show grayscale bevel.- Mercutio now uses the correct menu hilight color for registered applications under System 7 or when system-wide platinum appearance is off.- Mercutio uses correct gray colors for menu background, bevels, and separators under Appearance Manager 1.0.2.- Fixed bug where MDEF_MenuKey would recognize hierarhical menus as menu items with "Escape" as key equivalent. Escape is not a valid menu shortcut.- Evidently the Apple menu cannot be used as a Mercutio menu: if you pass the Apple menu to MDEF_MenuKey, the MDEF never gets called. Changed MDEF_MenuKey API to try to find Mercutio on its own if the passed menuHandle isn't a Mercutio handle. If it still can't find Mercutio, it beeps and returns 0.- Adjusted separator spacing when "System-wide Platinum Appearance" turned off.For a list of changes in previous versions please see:http://www.digitalalchemy.com/mercutio/version-history.html
