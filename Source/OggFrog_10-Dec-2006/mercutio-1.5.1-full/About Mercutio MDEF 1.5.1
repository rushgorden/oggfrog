The Mercutio MDEF is a Menu DEFinition resource that allow developers to easilyand elegantly extend the power of their application menus. These MDEFs allowmenus to have multiple-modifier key-equivalents (e.g. shift-command-C),custom icons, item callbacks, and other goodies.NEW Web Site============The Mercutio web site has moved to the new Digital Alchemy site:             http://www.digitalalchemy.com/mercutio/To receive announcements about future versions Mercutio, please send e-mail to"majordomo@lists.stanford.edu" with "subscribe mercutio-news" in the body (notsubject) of the message.New Features in 1.5 and 1.5.1=============================The following new features were added to 1.5 and 1.5.1. Initial MacOS 8 features originally introduced in version 1.3.4 have been rolled into version 1.5:	- Fixed many cosmetic bugs -- see release notes for details.	- Added support for Appearance Manager 1.0, 1.0.1 and 1.0.2 menus,	  including Platinum Theme.	- Fixed a bug that would unlock GDevice handles when Mercutio was used	  to display popup menus and could cause a crash. For details, 	  please see:	  	  	http://www.digitalalchemy.com/mercutio/GDeviceProblem.html	  		- Changed the semantics of sameAlternateAsLastTime constant to	  "don't redraw by default". Fixes flickering in menu items whose 	  icons are set by callback routines.	- Cleared purgeable flag from MDEFFont NFNT resource; this could cause 	  the font to be unloaded and incorrect glyphs to show up in menus.	Mercutio features include:   - Support for all 4 modifier keys (command, shift, option, control)  - Support for non-printing keys (function keys, page up/down,    arrow keys, spacebar, etc)  - Graphic icons for non-printing keys: non-printing key equivalents    such as page up/ down, home/help, etc. can be drawn as text or    as icons that look like the keys on the extended keyboard.  - Dynamic items: items whose contents change depending on what     modifier keys are being held down (e.g. when the option key is    held down, Save becomes Save All).  - Application callback routine to let you decide on the fly what    the item contents should be.  - Support for icon suites, small and large icons, and SICNs in    hierarchical menu items.  - Support for window font/size: Mercutio now correctly draws popup menus    in the current font and size. This means you can use Mercutio for    Geneva 9-pt popup menus and the like.  - Support for WorldScript. Mercutio now supports menus in non-western    scripts (Japanese, Arabian, etc), and correctly draws under    right-to-left system text alignment.  - User-definable style mapping: developer determines which style    bits are used as feature flags  - System 7's Balloon Help and True Gray.  - Color menus.  - 99% compatible with standard MDEF.    The Mercutio MDEF works under System 6.0.4 or later, with or withoutColor QuickDraw. Mercutio is fully compatible with System 7, and supportsall the features of the System MDEF. Integrating the MDEF into your programshouldn't take more than 15 minutes.The documentation for Mercutio follows the style of Apple's Inside Macintoshmanuals, and is in Adobe's Acrobat format.Licensing=========Developers may use Mercutio free of charge as long as they give mecredit in the About box and documentation, and send me a copy of thefinal program (including future upgrades for as long as they usethe MDEF.)
